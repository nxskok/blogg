## Introduction

Let's suppose you have a data frame like this:

```{r, echo=F}
d <- tribble(
  ~x1, ~x2, ~y,
  "one", "two", "two",
  "four", "three", "four",
  "seven", "nine", "eight",
  "six", "eight", "seven",
  "fourteen", "nine", "twelve"
)
```

```{r}
d
```

What you want to do is to change all the even numbers in columns `x1` and `x2`, but *not* `y`, to the number versions of themselves, so that, for example, `eight` becomes `8`.
This would seem to be a job for `str_replace_all`, but how to manage the multitude of changes?

## Making a lot of changes with `str_replace_all`

I learned today that you can feed `str_replace_all` a *named vector*. Wossat, you say? Well, one of these:

```{r}
quantile(1:7)
```

The numbers are here the five-number summary; the things next to them, that say which percentile they are, are the `names` attribute. You can make one of these yourself like this:

```{r}
x <- 1:3
x
names(x) <- c("first", "second", "third")
x
```

The value of this for us is that you can feed the boatload of potential changes into `str_replace_all` by feeding it a named vector of the changes it might make.

In our example, we wanted to replace the even numbers by the numeric versions of themselves, so let's make a little data frame with all of those:

```{r}
changes <- tribble(
  ~from, ~to,
  "two", "2",
  "four", "4",
  "six", "6",
  "eight", "8",
  "ten", "10",
  "twelve", "12",
  "fourteen", "14"
)
```

I think this is as high as we need to go. I like a `tribble` for this so that you can easily see what is going to replace what.

For the named vector, the *values* are the new values (the ones I called `to` in `changes`), while the *names* are the old ones (`from`). So let's construct that. There is one extra thing: I want to replace whole words only (and not end up with something like `4teen`, which sounds like one of those 90s boy bands), so what I'll do is to put "word boundaries"^[[This Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24085680/why-do-backslashes-appear-twice) explains why the backslashes need to be doubled. The answer is for Python, but the same issue applies to R.] around the `from` values:^[This means that the number names only match if they are surrounded by non-word characters, that is, spaces, or the beginning or end of the text.]


```{r}
my_changes <- changes$to
names(my_changes) <- str_c("\\b", changes$from, "\\b")
my_changes
```

and that seems to reflect the changes we want to make. So let's make it go, just on columns `x1` and `x2`:^[The modern way to do this is to use `across`, but I wrote this post in 2019, and this is all we had then.]

```{r}
d %>% mutate_at(
  vars(starts_with("x")),
       ~ str_replace_all(., my_changes)
  )
```

"for each of the columns that starts with `x`, replace everything in it that's in the recipe in `my_changes`."

It seems to have worked, and not a 90s boy band in sight.
